FIR Filter for floating and fixed point 
	key point : seperating data type specifications from algorithm code
	allows:
		re-using algorithm with different data types
		keep algorithm clean
		keep algorithm code more readable
		switch between fixed point and floating point for comparison
		switch between variations of fixed-point code with changing the algorithm code
	y(n) = b(1)*x(n) + b(2)*x(n-1) + ... + b(end)*x(n-length(b)+1)
	
	realistic input tests:
		impulses
		sum of sinusoids
		chirp
		
	use "fir1" from signal processing toolbox for generating coefficients
	b = fir1(11,0.25)
